        "\n",
        "According to Newtonian gravitation, if there were only a single planet orbiting the Sun, it would orbit in an ellipse.  This is a fact we verified numerically in the first project.  The point of closest approach of such a planet is called the **perihelion** of its orbit.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our solar system, there isn't just a single planet orbiting the sun, there are 8.  One might wonder what effect the gravitational interactions between these planets have on their orbits.  If you're an astronomer, you don't have to wonder; you can't just go out and observe the planetary orbits.  If you do this precisely enough, you'll find that Mercury's perihelion precesses -- it doesn't stay stationary but rotates at some angular velocity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Observations reveal that the total precession is about 574 arcseconds per century.  The dominant contribution to this precession, more than 90% of it, is due to the gravitational interactions with other planets.  The rest of the effect is primarily due to corrections to Newtonian gravitation from general relativity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Show, using numerical simulation, that most of Mercury's perihelion precession can be accounted for by Newtonian gravitational interactions with the other planets by simulating the entire solar system for sufficiently long that the precession becomes measurable.  Do not assume that the sun is stationary -- this approximate fact should emerge from you simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you're familiar with general relativity, you might try to also take on the challenge of showing numerically that including general relativistic effects allows one to account for the remainder of the precession not accounted for by Newtonian gravitation.\n",

        "\n",
        "When the quantum harmonic oscillator is put into contact with a heat bath at absolute temperature $T$, there is some probability $p_n(T)$ that the system will occupy each of its energy eigenstates proportional to the Boltzmann factor associated with that state.  This can be used to determine an expression for the average energy the system will have in equilibrium:\n",

        "\n",
        "We have already seen one way to numerically determine this ensemble average energy using MCMC in the case of the Ising model: we can generate a sequence of the system's states using Metropolis-Hastings and use this sequence of states to compute an approximation to the ensemble average value of any observable we desire such as the equilibrium average energy.\n",
        "\n",
        "It turns out that there is another way to do this using Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and MCMC -- so-called **path integral monte carlo**.  See the appendix below for notes on the path integral that you may find useful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compute and plot $\\langle \\hat H\\rangle$ versus $T$ (or $\\beta$) for the quantum harmonic oscillator analytically first by simply performing the sum over states written above (or some equivalent procedure you might be familiar with from stat mech), then do the same using path integral monte carlo.  Make sure your results agree reasonably well.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Advice: when I was first doing this, I found it useful to make sure I understood how to sample from a familiar continuous probability distribution on $\\mathbb R^N$ before tackling the path integral.  A good choice is a multi-variate Gaussian because you can check your sampling results against built-in Gaussian samplers in scientific Python packages e.g. numpy/scipy.\n",
